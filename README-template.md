This should be the last dinky readme file I have associated with these challenges. I had not realized the serious implications of my actions in uploading all of these solutions for public consumption until just this morning. Again, leaving errors to learn from later.

This challenge went better than the others mostly. Still some pixel-perfect and vertical-align issues. Hoping to get a pro account soon, so I can have access to Figma files and learn how to use those!
